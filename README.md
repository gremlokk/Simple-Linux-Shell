# Simple-Linux-Shell
The the shell program can be executed in a Linux terminal by navigating to the directory that contains MYSHELL.
Do the following once in the directory that contains MYSHELL:
	1. Compile shell: gcc- o myshell MYSHELL.c
	2. Run shell: ./myshell
		- if you do not have permission to run shell please do chmod u+x MYSHELL.c
	3.Repeat steps 2 & 3
	
Once the shell is executed, the user can type any linux commands that they normally would in a normal Linux terminal.

Note: the cd or "change directory" is not implemented to work. only commands that are apart of the /usr/bin/ & /bin directories
